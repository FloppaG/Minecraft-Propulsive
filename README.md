## FAQ

### What is this mod about?

Propulsive is a Minecraft mod that plans to bring a much more interactive environment - Most other mods lack the ability to explore space itself, they usually have some kind of a map screen and you select where you want to go. Propulsive allows you to physically travel to you destination as well as build stuff in space!


## Building

The mod requires nothing special to build. You can simply clone the mod and run the following:

`./gradlew build` (Linux)

`gradlew.bat` (Windows)

However, doing this means there is more than likely going to be many problematic bugs/issues, so be warned! It is recommended to stick to the builds in the releases tab, or use the ones on Modrinth/Curseforge (As of writing, the mod is not on Curseforge or Modrinth yet)
