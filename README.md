## FAQ

### What is this mod about?

Propulsive is a Minecraft mod that plans to bring a much more interactive environment - Most other mods lack the ability to explore space itself, they usually have some kind of a map screen and you select where you want to go. Propulsive allows you to physically travel to you destination as well as build stuff in space!
