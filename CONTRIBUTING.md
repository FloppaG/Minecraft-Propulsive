## Contributing

- Avoid using code from other mods, if you do, **please** make sure you have permission from the respective mod's developers
- Try and keep the indentation to tabs rather than spaces
- Keep code consistent
- Avoid mixins where possible - we don't want to be too invasive.
- Make sure your PRs build before making them! This is incredibly important, we can't merge broken pull requests!
